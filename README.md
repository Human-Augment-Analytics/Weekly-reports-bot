# Weekly Reports Bot

This repository contains a Slack bot that downloads weekly PDF reports from Slack, parses their contents, and posts a summarized update back to the channel.

> ⚠️ **Current Status**  
> This bot is currently being used **only in the `stroud-r-for-evolution` Slack channel** for experimentation and format validation.  
> It is under active testing and refinement and is not yet production-ready.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Automatically collect weekly PDF reports shared in Slack  
- Extract structured content from those reports  
- Generate a concise progress summary  
- Post the summary back to the channel for visibility and discussion  

## Notes

- The bot expects reports to follow a consistent naming format.
- This is an experimental internal tool and may evolve as the workflow is refined.
- It has not been deployed to other Slack channels.
